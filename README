This directory contains source code and data files necessary to use 
the Lederer & Aringer (2009) enhanced C,N low-T opacities with MESA.

After compiling the library, installing the data files, and using
the provided run_star_extras to produce a star executable you would
add use_other_kap = .true. to your controls inlist to use kapCN.
