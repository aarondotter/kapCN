Abstract:
    We provide low temperature opacity data that incorporate varied abundances 
    of the elements carbon and nitrogen. In the temperature range that we focus 
    at, molecules are the dominant opacity source. Our dataset spans a large 
    metallicity range and shall deliver the necessary input data for stellar 
    evolution models as well as other applications. We conduct chemical 
    equilibrium calculations in order to evaluate the partial pressures of 
    neutral atoms, ions and molecules. Based on a large dataset containing 
    atomic line and continuum data, and, most importantly, a plethora of 
    molecular lines, we subsequently calculate Rosseland mean opacity 
    coefficients. This is done not only for a number of different metallicities,
    but also for varied abundances of the isotopes ^{12}C and ^{14}N at each 
    metallicity. The molecular data comprise the main opacity sources at either 
    an oxygen-rich or carbon-rich chemistry. We tabulate the opacity 
    coefficients as a function of temperature and, basically, density. Already 
    within a certain chemistry regime an alteration in the carbon abundance 
    causes, due to the special role of the CO molecule, considerable changes in 
    the Rosseland opacity. The transition from a scaled solar (i.e. oxygen-rich)
    mixture to the carbon-rich regime results in opacities that can, at low 
    temperatures, be orders of magnitude different compared to the initial 
    situation. The reason is that different molecular absorbers make up the mean
    opacity in either case. A varying abundance of nitrogen has less pronounced 
    effects but, nevertheless, cannot be neglected.

Description:
    The database of Rosseland opacities consists of 14 files (kR_Z?E-?.dat), one
    for each metallicity. The available values of the metallicity are listed in
    the file kR_Z_fCN.dat together with the respective enhancement factors for 
    ^{12}C and ^{14}N. This file contains information equivalent to Table 3 from
    the paper. The data files consist of a header indicating the abundances used
    (Lodders 2003), the initial metallicity, the initial mass fractions for 
    ^{12}C, ^{14}N and the alpha elements, and a look-up table for the actual 
    data block. This block is made up of 63 rectangular data arrays where 
    the logarithm of the Rosseland opacity (log {kappa}_R [cm^2 g^-1]) is 
    tabulated as a function of the logarithm of the gas temperature (log T [K]) 
    and the logarithm of R (log R [g cm^-3 K^-3 10^18], with R={rho}/(T_6)^3 and
    T_6=T/(10^6 K)). The ranges covered are 3.2 <= log T <= 4.05 with a step 
    size of 0.05, and -7.0 <= log R <= 1.0 with a step size of 0.5. The 63 
    tables result from the variation of the hydrogen mass fraction 
    (X=0.5,0.7,0.8), and the mass fractions X(^{12}C) [7 different values] and 
    X(^{14}N) [3 different values]. The tables are ordered such that the mass 
    fraction X(^{12}C) varies fastest followed by the hydrogen mass fraction 
    and X(^{14}N). For future compatibility a data field for the alpha element 
    enhancement factor was introduced in the look-up table.

DATA TABLES (the structure described below is repeated 63 times)
   10 blank lines
    1 comment line repeating the column labels from the look-up table
    1 data line repeating the parameters from the look-up table
    1 blank line

    1 line containing the label "log R"
    1 line containing...
     - the label "log T"
     - the values of log R from -7.0 to 1.0 
       in the format (1X,F6.3) repeated 17 times
   18 lines containing...
     - the respective log T values from 3.2 to 4.05 in the format (F5.3)
     - the values of log {kappa}_R
       in the format (1X,F6.3) repeated 17 times

    In symbolic form the Rosseland opacities as a function of
    log T and log R are arranged in rectangular arrays like that:

                     log R
      log T -7.000   ...   1.000
      3.200 ##.### ##.### ##.### 
      ...   ##.### ##.### ##.###
      4.050 ##.### ##.### ##.###

    The respective opacity coefficient (represented by ##.###) is located at the
    crossing point of the log R vs. log T grid.
